* <2010-03-21 Sun> "Significant Other" story -- ends with him saying:

"We should stop seeing each other."
And she looks at him, huge as a mountain, on every news station, and says:
"Easy for you to say."

The shape of this should be easy:
  First bit is about her relationship w/ this dude.
  Ice cream cone melting down his hand.
  Then the extreme growth, the expanding.
  A couple of quick snapshots of him growing.

He barely fits in doors. He's got to duck through entryways and fold himself into cars.

He holds me, King-Kong-style, up to his lips. I stand on the greasy flat of his palm and kiss his giant damp lips. Lips
like innertubes. I can see the thick whorls and ridges of his skin. His whiskers a giant forest beneath me.

He takes a leak and destroys half of Scarborough:
"Motherfuckers had it coming," he says.

Boils the lake with hot piss.

Helicopters swarm his head, he doesn't swat them: he's a gentle giant.

A glandular thing, he says, a growth hormone out of whack. He's medicated.

I like them big.

Two guys with wedding bands on their fingers and meshback caps are reciting high-school football scores out of the
paper. 

I think this will seem too silly, too high-concept, perhaps?

"Aren't you afraid he'll squash you?" Rayanne asks. 
No, I'm not. It's not like he lays *down* on me when we fuck, Rayanne. He's a big guy, sure. 

Hmm. So what's this about, really?
