A glandular thing. Chemicals mixed wrong in his blood. When I met him, he was 6'9'', then 6'10'', then 7 feet. I'd
always liked them big--thickness in the neck and arms, fleshy baggage around the middle--but Bodie gave me a new sense
of scale. He kept gaining weight: two-sixty, two-eighty, three hundred pounds.

He was a nightclub bouncer and had a musty apartment in Cabbagetown. Our first night together, he poured chocolate
syrup in a stripe down my belly. I was sold. The next morning he'd grown too big for the bed.

Extreme type of gigantism, he said. He took drugs for it, but they couldn't match his doses with his growth rate.

My friends told me, "Leave him. Before you get squished." But he'd never do that: he used to keep one of my pubic hairs
folded under his tongue for hours. A careful awareness of my fragility. I'd lay on him, listen to his big heart pump in
and out like the ocean. He plucked me flowers from rooftop gardens only he could reach, let me jungle-gym up his
legs. He was four hundred pounds, then five. Ten feet tall. Eleven.

I talked marriage in roundabout ways. Bodie laughed, said our wedding'd need an aerial photographer, a camera on a
blimp. Each of his hands big enough to cup both my breasts at once.

He got tangled in telephone lines. Pigeons roosted in his beard. He was three stories tall. Finally, I thought, a man I
could take home to mother. It'd crush her completely. More effective than piercings or drugs.

On night I found him dazed in Brickworks Park. A tiny ice cream cone melted between his fingers, dripped down his
wrist.

"We gotta stop seeing each other," he said. 

"Easy for you to say." He was fifty feet tall, impossible \emph{not} to see.

"Too much blood to push around," he said. "Doctors say my heart's gonna freeze up."

"I'll have to warm you, then." I nuzzled into the folds of his neck.

Of course they pushed him to the edge of the city. Of course they set up spotlights and nets. Big as a small mountain.
He'd wade into the lake, suck the water level down a foot. Had to uproot a forest to feed himself. Unsustainable,
really.

I drove up to Algonquin to visit him for the last time. He grabbed a low-hanging cloud, pressed it to his face like a
Santa beard. We made each other laugh until we cried, and his tears punched holes in the dirt. Then he held me, King
Kong-style, up to his face. I stood on the greasy flat of his palm and kissed his giant lips.

"I want to get into your mouth," I said. 

He held his breath. Nodded.

I pictured the swarm of veins deep inside him, pictured myself swimming through his blood. I climbed up the wet flesh of
his bottom lip and put one bare foot down onto his tongue.
