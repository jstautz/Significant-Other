A glandular thing. Chemicals mixed wrong in his blood. When I met him, he was 6'9'', then 6'10'', then 7 feet even. I'd
always liked them big--thickness in the neck and arms, fleshy baggage around the middle--but Bodie gave me a new sense
of scale. He kept gaining weight: two-thirty, two-fifty, two-eighty.

He was a nightclub bouncer and lived in a musty apartment in Cabbagetown. Our first night together, he poured chocolate
syrup in a stripe down my belly, and I was sold. Each one of his hands big enough to cup both my breasts at once. The
next morning, he'd grown too big for the bed.

My friends told me, "Leave him before you get squished." But he'd never do that to me. I'd lay on him, listen to his
heartbeat rush in and out like the ocean. He was three-sixty, then three-seventy. Eight feet
tall. Nine. His apartment . His pants stopped fitting, but it was okay: he never kept them on for long, anyway.

He kept growing. Had trouble with doorways and had to fold himself into cars. I talked marriage in roundabout ways. He
laughed, said our wedding would need an arial photographer, a camera on a blimp.

They no longer let him on the bus.



% After sex, I tried on his gigantic sweat-rimed shirts, and he pulled them down off my shoulders.
