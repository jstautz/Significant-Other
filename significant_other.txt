A glandular thing. Chemicals mixed wrong in his blood. When I met him, he was 6'9'', then 6'10'', then 7 feet even. I'd
always liked them big--thickness in the neck and arms, fleshy baggage around the middle--but Bodie gave me a new sense
of scale. He kept gaining weight: two-thirty, two-fifty, two-eighty.

He was a nightclub bouncer and lived in a musty apartment in Cabbagetown. Our first night together, he poured chocolate
syrup in a stripe down my belly, and I was sold. Each one of his hands big enough to cup both my breasts at once. The
next morning, he'd grown too big for the bed.

He took drugs for it, but they couldn't up his dosages fast enough to match his body mass. A type of gigantism, he
said. His tattoos stretched to blurs.

My friends told me, "Leave him before you get squished." But he'd never do that to me. I'd lay on him, listen to his
heartbeat rush in and out like the ocean. He was three hundred fifty pounds, then three-eighty. Eight feet
tall. Nine. His pants stopped fitting, but it was okay: he never kept them on for long, anyway.

He started having trouble with doorways, had to fold himself into cars, had to smoke four cigarettes at once to get a
buzz. But he could pluck flowers for me from rooftop gardens. Let me climb jungle-gym up his legs. I talked marriage in
roundabout ways. He laughed, said our wedding would need an arial photographer, a camera on a blimp. He kept his heels
off the ground when he walked for fear of knocking shit over.

They no longer let him on the bus. His landlord evicted him. I spent days helping him sew together tents to sleep
under. He grew to two stories tall. Pigeons roosted in his beard. Finally, I thought, a man I could take home to mother
to crush her completely. A giant, impossible to argue against, more effective than piercings or drugs.





He was spiced with sweat, gave off an odour like pencil shavings. The smell of mutancy, of malignant genetics?

% After sex, I tried on his gigantic sweat-rimed shirts, and he pulled them down off my shoulders.
