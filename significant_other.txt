A glandular thing. Chemicals mixed wrong in his blood. When I met him, he was 6'9", then 6'10", then 7 feet even. I'd
always liked them big--thickness in the neck and arms, fleshy baggage around the middle--but Bodie gave me a new sense
of scale. He kept gaining weight: two-thirty, two-fifty, two-eighty.

He was a nightclub bouncer and lived in a musty apartment in Cabbagetown. Our first night together, he poured chocolate
syrup in a stripe down my belly. Right then, I was sold. I did his laundry the next morning, tried on his gigantic
sweat-rimed shirts.

My friends told me, "No way, girl. Leave him before you get squished." But I was usually on top--when we made love, I'd
slide over him like he was an ocean. 

He kept growing. Had trouble with doorways and had to fold himself into cars. I talked marriage in roundabout ways. He
laughed, said our wedding would need an arial photographer, a camera on a blimp.

They no longer let him on the bus.
