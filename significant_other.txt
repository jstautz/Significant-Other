Significant Other

A glandular thing. Chemicals mixed wrong in his blood. When I met him, he was 6'9'', then 6'10'', then 7 feet. I'd always liked them big--thickness in the neck and arms, fleshy baggage around the middle--but Bodie gave me a new sense of scale. He kept gaining weight: two-sixty, two-eighty, three hundred pounds.

He was a nightclub bouncer and had a musty apartment in Cabbagetown. Our first night together, he poured chocolate syrup in a stripe down my belly and I was sold. By morning he'd grown too big for the bed.

Extreme type of gigantism, he said. He took drugs for it, but they couldn't match his doses with his growth rate.

My friends said, "Leave him. Before you get squished." But he'd never do that: he used to keep one of my pubic hairs folded under his tongue for hours. A careful awareness of my fragility. I'd lay on him, listen to his big heart pump in and out like the ocean. He plucked me flowers from rooftop gardens, let me jungle-gym up his legs. He was four hundred pounds, then five. Ten feet tall. Eleven.

I talked marriage in roundabout ways. Bodie laughed, said our wedding would need an aerial photographer, a camera on a blimp. Each of his hands big enough to cup both my breasts at once.

He got tangled in telephone lines. Pigeons roosted in his beard. He was three stories tall, four. Finally, I thought, a man I could take home to mother. It'd crush her completely. More effective than piercings or drugs.

One afternoon I found him dazed in Brickworks Park. A tiny ice cream cone melted between his fingers, dripped down his wrist.

"We gotta stop seeing each other," he said.

"Easy for you to say." He was fifty feet tall, impossible *not* to see.

"Too much blood to push around inside me," he said. "Doctors say my heart's gonna freeze up."

"I'll have to warm you, then." I nuzzled into the folds of his neck.

Of *course* they pushed him to the edge of the city. Of *course* they set up spotlights and nets. Big as a small mountain, he'd wade into the lake, suck the water level down a foot. Had to uproot forests to feed himself. Unsustainable, really.

I drove past the police barricades, up into Algonquin to visit him. He grabbed a low-hanging cloud, pressed it to his face like a Santa beard. We made each other laugh until we cried and his tears punched holes in the dirt. Then he held me, King Kong-style, up to his face. I stood on the greasy flat of his palm and kissed his giant lips.

"I want to get into your mouth," I said.

He nodded. Opened wide.

I pictured the swarm of veins inside him, imagined swimming through his blood. I climbed up the wet flesh of his bottom lip and put one bare foot down onto his tongue.
